# Image Processing I
## Project 1
In this project we were tasked with the following: 
Use the image given below to map the intensity to the full dynamic range of 0-255.
1. First find the min and max values from the image for one of the three bands (since it is gray level
image all three bands will have same pixel intensities at a given location).
2. The intensity range can be mapped to full range (0-255) by a simple mapping function (H) which
maps the input pixel intensity min to 0 and max to 255. Derive the mapping function and
implement using python arrays and for loops.
